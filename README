Older templating plugins for VIM often used simple markup for placeholders 
(e.g. <+VARIABLE_NAME+>). A placeholder was simple a pattern you could easily 
search for. Some newer templating plugins support dynamic replacement of 
placeholders with the same name.

The stakeholders plugin turns your old templating system into a high 
potential overachiever. It provides dynamic replacement of placeholders 
for older templating plugins. By default, it assumes placeholders match 
/<+\([[:alpha:]_]\+\)+>/ since this pattern is used in several 
templating systems. You can easily change that pattern by setting 
|g:stakeholders#def| or b:stakeholders_def.


Usage~

The tskeleton templating plugin provides a parameter 
(|g:tskeleton#enable_stakeholders|) that enables integration with the 
stakeholders plugin. For other templating plugins, you have to enable 
stakeholders by calling either |stakeholders#EnableBuffer()| or 
|stakeholders#EnableInRange()|.
