Older templating plugins for VIM often used simple markup for placeholders 
(e.g. <+VARIABLE_NAME+>). A placeholder was simple a pattern you could easily 
search for. Some newer templating plugins support dynamic replacement of 
placeholders with the same name.

This plugin provides dynamic replacement of placeholders for older 
templating plugins. By default, it assumes placeholders match 
/<+\([[:alpha:]_]\+\)+>/ since this pattern is used in several 
templating systems. You can easily change that pattern by setting 
|g:stakeholders#rx| or b:stakeholders_rx.


Usage~

The tskeleton templating plugin provides a parameter 
(|g:tskeleton#enable_stakeholders|) that enables integration with the 
stakeholders plugin. For other templating plugins, you have to enable 
stakeholders by calling either |stakeholders#EnableBuffer()| or 
|stakeholders#EnableInRange()|.
